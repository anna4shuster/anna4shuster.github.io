# A website about Calvin

Calvin, named after the 16th-century theologian John Calvin, 
is a six-year-old boy with spiky blond hair and a distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, 
black pants and sneakers.[34] Despite his poor grades in school, 
Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through a sophisticated vocabulary, 
philosophical mind and creative/artistic talent. 
Watterson described Calvin as having "not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth", 
a "little too intelligent for his age", lacking in restraint and not yet having the experience 
to "know the things that you shouldn't do."
The comic strip largely revolves around Calvin's inner world, 
and his largely antagonistic experiences with those outside of it (fellow students, authority figures and his parents).
